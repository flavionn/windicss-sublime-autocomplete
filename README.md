Windi CSS Autocomplete for Sublime Text 3
=============

Windi CSS Autocomplete plugin for [Windi CSS](https://windicss.org).

Note: This plugin only autocompletes based on the default Windi CSS class names. It does not extend autocomplete based on your customized `windi.config.js`.

You may want to remove the `:` character in your `word_separators` setting in your user **Preference.sublime-settings** file. This will prevent autocomplete from breaking on breakpoint and pseudo classes used within Windi.

    // Characters that are considered to separate words
    "word_separators": "./\\()\"'-:,.;<>~!@#$%^&*|+=[]{}`~?",
